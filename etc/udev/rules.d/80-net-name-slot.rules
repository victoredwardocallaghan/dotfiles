# This file masks persistent renaming rules for network devices. If you
# delete this file, /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/80-net-name-slot.rules may
# rename network devices according to ID_NET_NAME_{ONBOARD,SLOT,PATH}
# properties of your network devices, with priority in that order. See
# the output of 'udevadm test-builtin net_id /sys/class/net/$interface'
# for details on what that new name might be.
